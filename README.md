# HashMapTester
This is a program designed to test the efficiency of HashMaps using Linear probing and Separate Chaining.
The HashMap sizes are trimmed to the nearest power of 2 for efficient re-hashing.


# What I Learned:
- HashMap methods
- Linear Probing
- Separate Chaining
- Tree Map
- Comparator Objects
- Key-Value pairs for Map Entry
